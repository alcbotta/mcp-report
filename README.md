This repository contains all the code discussed in my medium article [Running an MCP Server and Client locally withÂ Ollama](https://medium.com/@alcbotta/running-an-mcp-server-and-client-locally-with-ollama-b8b4c098c7fb)

To run the application, you first need to build and run the Docker image for backend app by following the instructions on the [Backend README.md](./backend/README.md)

Next, you should build the Docker image for the MCP Server by following the instructiosn: [MCP Server README.md](./mcp-server/README.md), in special, the section: `How to build the docker image`

Finally, follow the instruction in the [MCP Client README.MD](./mcp-client/README.md) to install all the necessary tools and run the MCP Client.
